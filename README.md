WARNING BEFORE USE THIS PROJECT'S CODE:

This is a project created on a whim by the author, all the code in this project is also spontaneous and does not follow any particular pattern (or if it does, it is half-hearted). The purpose of its creation is merely to kill time, with absolutely no plans or other objectives for this project. However, if this project still happens to catch your attention and you wish to use it, you must accept the following:

    - Smell code everywhere
    - No adherence to any pattern, or if there is, it's half-hearted
    - Confusing logic (because the author is super lazy)

In conclusion: This project is completely free, you can take it and do whatever you want with it, as long as it does not negatively affect others.
